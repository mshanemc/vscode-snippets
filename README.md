here's snippets I use in vscode for Salesforce development.

These would got in `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets`

Because vscode stores them in a giant file per language, there's not a good way to modularize these and take/leave some/all of them.

So you'll probably end up cut and pasting if you're running your own snippets and want some of mine.
